I created mock orders within DatabaseMock  
I used these mocks to test orders (OrderTest.java), items (ItemTest.java),  
order items (OrderItemsTest.java) and addresses (AdddressTest.java).  

I created a Security Mock to test the security interface.  
 -SecurityMock.Java  
 -SecurityTest.java

I created a PartManager Mock to test the Part Manager interface.  
 -PartManagerMock.java  
 -PartManagerTest.java  
    
 Controller.Java   
 Finally, I also created a bunch of XML files that my main method interacts with ( These   
 XML files have various things wrong with them (invalid part numbers, dealers). Running the main method   
 shows the various outputs that that will happen if we have good, or invalid data.  
 
 Regards.
